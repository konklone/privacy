RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
```


```
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)

Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
```


```
Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 203 more bytes)
